abstract = {Nonlinear sound propagation in a stressed glass bead pack is investigated via amplitude measurements of harmonic generation. We evidence two distinct regimes of sound-matter interaction: reversible and irreversible, as a function of the ratio rs between dynamic strain and static one. In the reversible regime, the higher harmonics generated agree well with a mean-field model based on the Hertz contact theory, and the coefficient of nonlinearity β deduced from the measured amplitude of second-harmonic is consistent with that deduced from the acoustoelastic measurement. Beyond a certain threshold (rs > 3\%), the interaction of sound wave with granular matter becomes irreversible, accompanied by a small compaction of the medium.},

abstract="Among the methods of experimental analysis photoelasticity plays a major role in the investigation of a three-dimensional model. Users of this technique are faced with two main problems: the difficulty of performing precise measurements in a three dimensional medium and the propagation of polarized light in anisotropic medium, (more precisely the effect of the rotation of the principal axes on optical phenomena). The first difficulty is often overcome by the classical technique of freezing and slicing. However this method has certain disadvantages such as time consumption, destructiveness and the problem due to a Poisson coefficient equal to.5. The second difficulty is considered but with some important hypotheses in the more classical techniques using scattered light. We first consider the practical need of taking into account the effect of rotation of the principal axes using an adequate optical theory even in the case of the analysis of a thin slice.",

	abstract = {A photoelastic material will reveal its internal stresses when observed through polarizing ﬁlters. This eye-catching property has enlightened our understanding of granular materials for over half a century, whether in the service of art, education, or scientiﬁc research. In this review article in honor of Robert Behringer, we highlight both his pioneering use of the method in physics research, and its reach into the public sphere through museum exhibits and outreach programs. We aim to provide clear protocols for artists, exhibit-designers, educators, and scientists to use in their own endeavors. It is our hope that this will build awareness about the ubiquitous presence of granular matter in our lives, enlighten its puzzling behavior, and promote conversations about its importance in environmental and industrial contexts. To aid in this endeavor, this paper also serves as a front door to a detailed wiki containing open, community-curated guidance on putting these methods into practice (AbedZadeh et al. in Photoelastic methods wiki https://git-xen.lmgc.univ-montp2.fr/PhotoElasticity/Main/wikis/home, 2019).},

abstract = "The diffusivity of ultrasound in an untextured aggregate of cubic crystallites is studied theoretically with a view towards nondestructive characterization of microstructures. Multiple scattering formalisms for the mean Green's dyadic and for the covariance of the Green's dyadic (and therefore for the energy density) based upon the method of smoothing are presented. The first-order smoothing approximation used is accurate to leading order in the anisotropy of the constituent crystallites. A further, Born, approximation is invoked which limits the validity of the calculation to frequencies below the geometrical optics regime. Known result for the mean field attenuations are recovered. The covariance is found to obey an equation of radiative transfer for which a diffusion limit is taken. The resulting diffusivity is found to vary inversely with the fourth power of frequency in the Rayleigh, long wavelength, regime and inversely with the logarithm of frequency on the short wavelength, stochastic, asymptote. The results are found to fit the experimental data.",
