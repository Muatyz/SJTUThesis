abstract = {Energy piles are dual-purpose foundation elements that transfer the building loads to the supporting soil and act as heat exchangers for heating and cooling. Energy piles are subjected to heating and cooling cycles over days and seasons, resulting in cyclic expansion and contraction. The cyclic expansion and contraction bring about the modification of vertical stress and the increase of vertical displacements on the piles, in other words, the thermo-mechanical behavior of the pile, the soil, and the soil–pile interface is changed by the cyclic thermal cycles. Investigation to know the effect of temperature cycles on soil–pile interface characteristics has high academic and significant engineering values. This paper intends to investigate the thermo-mechanical response of soil–pile interface under different types of cyclic thermal loadings, to better understand the behavior of energy piles and their surrounding soils after the buildings are constructed and the geothermal activation. Direct shear tests are performed by using a new interface direct shear test machine composed of a temperature controlling device to assess the influence of different cyclic thermal loadings on the shear behavior of Fontainebleau sand–concrete interface. Direct shear tests are carried out after three different thermal loadings, i.e., a constant temperature of 13 °C, and two different kinds of cyclic cooling–heating​ (8–18 °C) loadings with 10 cycles (namely CT-1 and CT-2). The horizontal stress and horizontal displacement are evaluated after the 10 thermal cycles in CT-1 and CT-2 programs, and the shear results are then compared. The results reveal that the cyclic thermal cycles increase the peak shear strength of CT-2, however they do not significantly affect the residual shear strength of both CT-1 and CT-2. The peak/residual interface friction angle of the reference test is 29.5∘/28.4°, after the 10 cyclic thermal cycles, it becomes to 28.9∘/27.9° for CT-1, and 31.7∘/28.5° for CT-2.}

abstract = {Propagation of acoustic waves in earth materials is controlled to a large extent by the properties of the solid frame of the material. In sedimentary materials, interactions at the grain contacts provide a key to understanding the frame properties. In this note, a recent theoretical model by Digby (1981) for acoustic velocities in dry, disordered sphere packs is discussed and applied to experimental data. Central to the model are the normal and tangential stiffnesses at the contacts between grains. We have inverted Digby’s results to give equations for the contact stiffnesses in terms of the measured velocities. These equations have been applied to experimental data from the literature for both unconsolidated glass beads and Berea sandstone at various confining pressures. Taken literally, these results indicate that interactions at real grain contacts are not well described by conventional Hertz-Mindlin contacts or by modified Digby contacts. Alternatively, the results indicate that the theory requires modifications such as additional contact interactions or distributions of grain sizes, coordination numbers, or contact stiffnesses.},

  abstract = {The constitutive law for granular materials is governed mainly by the intergranular friction, which depends strongly on the gravitational force or effective isotropic stress. Such experiments are mostly performed with relatively high effective isotropic stress. This fact poses serious limitations on the formulation of a materially objective constitutive model based on experiments performed on earth. This paper analyzes the limited experimental data of shear strength and rheology of granular materials, subject to low effective stress conditions obtained in microgravity {$\mu$}g as well as in 1 g conditions. Results from these experiments show that granular materials may have an extremely high macroscopic peak friction angle and clear nonlinear S-shape non-Bingham fluidity in low effective stress conditions. In this paper, the classical limit equilibrium method is employed, and a rheological constitutive model is used to study experimental data. The limit equilibrium method enables the authors to correlate the bearing capacity of sand foundation with high peak friction angles under varying effective stress conditions. The calibrated analytical solution for the rheological constitutive model under low effective stress conditions, predicts a clear S-shape correlation of the viscous shear stress and shear strain rate. The mutation or inflection point takes place around the in-situ Niigata earthquake shear strain rate. The results of this paper are of great relevance to the assessment of seismic liquefaction hazards of infrastructure on earth.},

abstract = {X-ray tomography study reveals that sheared granular mixtures with size difference segregate under convection and arching effects. Granular mixtures with size difference can segregate upon shaking or shear. However, the quantitative study of this process remains difficult because it can be influenced by many mechanisms. Conflicting results on similar experimental systems are frequently obtained when the experimental conditions are not well controlled, which is mainly due to the fact that many mechanisms can be at work simultaneously. Moreover, it is often that macroscopic or empirical measures, which lack microscopic physical bases, are used to explain the experimental findings and therefore cannot provide an accurate and complete depiction of the overall process. Here, we carry out a detailed and systematic microscopic structure and dynamics study of a cyclically sheared granular system with rigorously controlled experimental conditions. We find that both convection and arching effect play important roles in the segregation process in our system, and we can quantitatively identify their respective contributions.}

While drawings are copied from the original, figures displaying data are redone for better readability. The translation is complemented by some bibliographical notes and an assessment of earlier work, wherein Hagen predicted the saturation of pressure with depth in 1852, and Huber-Burnand demonstrated that saturation qualitatively as early as in 1829.

Using a Green function technique, we solve this set of equations systematically for the displacement field at distance x from the source.

abstract = {Abstract Stress accumulation and release reflected by acoustic emissions (AEs) during shearing of granular materials provide important information on failure mechanisms in seismic faults and landslides controlled by stick-slip. Among many characteristics (amplitude, energy, counts, and frequency) of AE signals generated by stick-slip, stress changes corresponding to various frequency AEs in different stages of the stick-slip process are not clear, which limits our knowledge of the characteristics of precursory signals before stick-slip failure. To better understand the physical mechanisms of granular stick-slip, we monitored the mechanical and AE signals using high-frequency (2 MHz) synchronous acquisition during constant-speed shear of packs of uniform glass beads with different sizes at different normal stresses. The release rate of AE energy was found to accelerate with the dilatation of the sample volume, and the stress drop of stick-slip was augmented with the increase of normal stress and particle size. Three characteristic events of single cycle stick-slip were observed in this study: main slip, minor slip, and microslip. We analyzed the AE frequency spectra of these three event types. Both main slip and minor slip corresponded to stress drop and generated high-frequency AEs (about several hundred kHz), while the AE frequencies generated by microslip were lower (about tens of kHz) and exhibited stress strengthening, which were not apparent in previous studies due to the low frequency of acquisition. We propose that the microslip is mainly due to sliding on grain contacts, while the main slip and minor slip resulted from breakage and reforming of force chains. Low-frequency AEs from microslip may suggest a crucial precursor of seismic faults and landslides.},

abstract = {Fast and slow earthquakes are two modes of energy release by the slip in tectonic fault rupture. Although fast and slow slips were observed in the laboratory stick–slip experiments, due to the sampling rate limitation, the details of the fault thickness variation were poorly understood. Especially, why a single fault would show different modes of slip remains elusive. Herein, we report on ring shear experiments with an ultrahigh sampling rate (10 MHz) that illuminate the different physical processes between fast and slow slip events. We show that the duration of slips ranged from dozens to hundreds of milliseconds. Fast slip events are characterized by continuous large-amplitude AE (acoustic emission) and somewhat intricate variation of the sample thickness: A short compaction pulse during the rapid release of stress is followed by dilation and vibrations of the sample thickness. As the slip ends, the thickness of the sample first recovers by slow compaction and then dilates again before nucleation of the following slip event. In contrast, during slow slip events, the shear stress reduction is accompanied by intermittent bursts of low-amplitude AE and sample dilation. We observed the detailed thickness variation during slips and found that dilation occurs during both fast and slow slips, which is consistent with natural observations of coseismic dilatation. This study may be used to reveal the mechanism of fault slips during fast and slow earthquakes, which explain the potential effect of fast and slow slips on stress redistribution and structural rearrangement in faults.}

We evidence two distinct regimes of sound-matter interaction: reversible and irreversible, as a function of the ratio rs between dynamic strain and static one. In the reversible regime, the higher harmonics generated agree well with a mean-field model based on the Hertz contact theory, and the coefficient of nonlinearity β deduced from the measured amplitude of second-harmonic is consistent with that deduced from the acoustoelastic measurement. Beyond a certain threshold (rs > 3\%), the interaction of sound wave with granular matter becomes irreversible, accompanied by a small compaction of the medium.},

abstract="Among the methods of experimental analysis photoelasticity plays a major role in the investigation of a three-dimensional model. Users of this technique are faced with two main problems: the difficulty of performing precise measurements in a three dimensional medium and the propagation of polarized light in anisotropic medium, (more precisely the effect of the rotation of the principal axes on optical phenomena). The first difficulty is often overcome by the classical technique of freezing and slicing. However this method has certain disadvantages such as time consumption, destructiveness and the problem due to a Poisson coefficient equal to.5. The second difficulty is considered but with some important hypotheses in the more classical techniques using scattered light. We first consider the practical need of taking into account the effect of rotation of the principal axes using an adequate optical theory even in the case of the analysis of a thin slice.",

	abstract = {A photoelastic material will reveal its internal stresses when observed through polarizing ﬁlters. This eye-catching property has enlightened our understanding of granular materials for over half a century, whether in the service of art, education, or scientiﬁc research. In this review article in honor of Robert Behringer, we highlight both his pioneering use of the method in physics research, and its reach into the public sphere through museum exhibits and outreach programs. We aim to provide clear protocols for artists, exhibit-designers, educators, and scientists to use in their own endeavors. It is our hope that this will build awareness about the ubiquitous presence of granular matter in our lives, enlighten its puzzling behavior, and promote conversations about its importance in environmental and industrial contexts. To aid in this endeavor, this paper also serves as a front door to a detailed wiki containing open, community-curated guidance on putting these methods into practice (AbedZadeh et al. in Photoelastic methods wiki https://git-xen.lmgc.univ-montp2.fr/PhotoElasticity/Main/wikis/home, 2019).},

Multiple scattering formalisms for the mean Green's dyadic and for the covariance of the Green's dyadic (and therefore for the energy density) based upon the method of smoothing are presented. The first-order smoothing approximation used is accurate to leading order in the anisotropy of the constituent crystallites. A further, Born, approximation is invoked which limits the validity of the calculation to frequencies below the geometrical optics regime. Known result for the mean field attenuations are recovered. The covariance is found to obey an equation of radiative transfer for which a diffusion limit is taken. The resulting diffusivity is found to vary inversely with the fourth power of frequency in the Rayleigh, long wavelength, regime and inversely with the logarithm of frequency on the short wavelength, stochastic, asymptote. The results are found to fit the experimental data.",
